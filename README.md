# Vocalizer

Vocalizer is a web application that aids with communication for people diagnosed with ASD, with a focus on children. The application will contain features to help the user ask questions, and express their thoughts and emotions. The application will also allow for the improvement of the user's communication skills, and increase a userâ€™s independence. Potential users for the application primarily consist of children with ASD and/or with any speech impairment.  

Several features are available, including: visual aids, a virtual keyboard, sign language tutorials, and task helper. Vocalizer is designed for users to use any of the mentioned features as they wish to suit their individual needs.  

This project was developed by Ryan C., Morgan C., Christopher D., Julia D., and Benjamin J. for their senior capstone project at Oakland University.
